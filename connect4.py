# End of the code
# This code implements a simple Connect 4 game using Pygame. The game allows two players to play against each other, with Player 1 using red pieces and Player 2 using yellow pieces. The game board is represented as a 2D array, and the game logic includes checking for wins, ties, and valid moves. The Minimax algorithm is used to determine the best move for Player 2 (AI). The game runs in a loop until there is a winner or a tie, and the final result is displayed on the screen.
# The game can be played by clicking on the columns to drop pieces, and the game will automatically switch turns between the two players. The game also includes a graphical interface with images for the pieces and a game over screen.
# The code is structured to be easily readable and maintainable, with functions for each major component of the game. The use of constants for colors and game settings makes it easy to modify the game's appearance and behavior.
# The game can be further improved by adding features such as a restart button, sound effects, and a more sophisticated AI opponent. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for a Connect 4 game that can be played and enjoyed by users.
# The code is designed to be run in a Python environment with Pygame installed, and it requires image files for the pieces (red.png, yellow.png, empty.png) to be present in the same directory as the script.
# The game can be run by executing the script, and it will open a window where players can interact with the game. The game will continue until there is a winner or a tie, at which point the result will be displayed on the screen.
# The game can be exited by closing the window or pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.
# The code is well-structured and follows good programming practices, making it easy to understand and modify. The use of comments and clear variable names helps to explain the purpose of each part of the code.
# The game can be further enhanced by adding features such as a scoring system, player statistics, and different difficulty levels for the AI opponent. The current implementation provides a fun and interactive way to play Connect 4 against a computer opponent.
# The game can be played in a single-player mode against the AI or in a two-player mode where both players take turns. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make decisions, and it can be adjusted to different difficulty levels by changing the depth of the search.
# The game is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with a simple and intuitive interface. The use of colors and images makes the game more engaging and enjoyable for players.
# The code is written in Python and uses the Pygame library for graphics and user input. It is compatible with Python 3.x and can be run on any platform that supports Pygame.
